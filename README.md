Name of the Project: Hymnal-History

Overview of the project: To start, the new name of the app is "Hymnal Hero"; I'd already named the repo "Hymnal History" when I created it, and I didn't want to change the name.

The MVP version of the app is a repository where song leaders can post data of hymns they lead during church services (title, hymnal, and page number, and topics). Once logged-in, they are able to add these songs through an online form. Once added, the songs will appear on a master list. These songs can then be edited and/or deleted.

Description of the user and the problem you are solving for them:

As a song leader, I need a way to easily find a list of songs that I lead and match them to their primary topic. This will make picking-out songs for each service a much easier task.
